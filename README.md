The seL4 project with no libc dependicies. This is a very very
subset of seL4 as of today it only able to create applications
on the order of the complexity and functionality of "helloworld",
so do not expect to much.

Dependencies
------------

My development system is Ubuntu 15.04 and here are the
primary dependencies and their versions that I'm using:

* gnu make v3.81
* gcc 4.9.2
* [git](https://github.com/git/git) v2.5.0
* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/) v3.2.3
* [ninja](https://github.com/martine/ninja) v1.6.0
* [repo](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) v1.12.26


Checkout build and run
----------------------

To checkout create a directory and use repo, repo sync (the repo
selfupdate is required as I'm using features that aren't available
unless you have the latest version):
```
mkdir sel4-newlibs
cd sel4-newlibs
repo init -u https://github.com/winksaville/sel4-newlibs-manifest.git
repo selfupdate
repo sync
```

By default this manifest setups a default configuration (.config) in
the root of the repos which builds all of the apps for x86 and can be
tested using qemu. So now use make to build and then run helloworld
under qemu:
```
make
make run app=helloworld
```

Other build options
-------------------

As I'm exploring build systems there are actually several options for
building. The "original" make system as we did above plus I've added
and tested two CMake generators. One for "Unix Makefiles" and the other
for "Ninja". To build for "Unix Makefiles" do the following:
```
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake ..
make
```

Then to run helloworld using qemu, which works for either cmake or root make:
```
make run_helloworld
```

The output should be something like, type 'ctrl-a' then 'x' to exit qemu:
```
...
Starting node #0
Testing log
Wrote to ksLog deadbeef
Hello, World!
```

To use "Ninja" its the same as "Unix Makefiles" except you need to specify
the generator:
```
cd ..
mkdir ninja-build
cd ninja-build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
ninja run_helloworld
```

Build performance
-----------------
I've choosen to use CMake because it allows for faster build times. A clean build with
ccache cleared and clean takes about 14 seconds on my desktop:

```
ccache -C -c -z -s; make clean; time make
$ ccache -C -c -z -s; make clean; time make
Cleared cache
Cleaned cache
Statistics cleared
cache directory                     /home/wink/.ccache

Using CMake "Unix Makefiles" takes about 8 seconds:

The most significant difference happens if there are no or only minor changes, thus
significantly reducing the test, edit, compile cycle. Here, if I change
apps/helloworld/src/main.c to print "Hello, Wink!\n" the standard make
takes almost 7 seconds:
```
$ time make

A world about configurations
----------------------------

Other configurations can be created using menuconfig or using an editor.
If the configuration ends with "defconfig" and exists in configs/ it
will be listed in the "make help" information and you can use it by
simply doing "make xxxx_defconfig":
```
make helloworld_x86_defconfig
```
